            This page is dedicated to projects I have made in DIGIT 100: Intro to Digital Humanities. So far, I have made a 3D scan model and a "dear diary" drawing. <br></br>These assignments are listed below. In class we have learned <b>Scaniverse, Web Annotations, HTML, CSS, XML, Commandline</b> and <b>GitHub.</b>

                <p style="line-height:0.80;">This was made from Scaniverse on an iPad, and annotated using Thinglink, Unfortunately it turned out very, well missing. I would like to redo this in the future with something more simple like my bedroom. Please move the model around and click the red circles for my annotations :)</p>

                My "Dear Data" project described my sleep through sheep. The color of the sheep represented the quality of my sleep. The number of sheep showed how many hours of rest I got. Finally, shaved sheep meant I woke up during the night and laying down sheep represented if I took a nap the following day.
