        <h2>Comparing Presidential Inaugural Addresses from Different Time Periods</h2>
        <div style="line-height:1.25;">
            <p>I decided on these 3 datasets using 3 different eras of United States history. First, I grouped presidents like George Washington and John Adams into Early American History. Then, came FDR and Truman. I grouped them into the war-time period or The Great Depression. Finally, modern day presidents like Biden and Trump were put into a seperate catergory. 
            <br></br>In terms of investigation, I would like to discover if the wording is still just as formal as before, the kinds of wording, and maybe the word count of the speeches.</p>

        <h3>Similarities and Differences</h3>
        <p>All documents mention The United States in some way. They also commonly talk from a perspective of the people with phrases like "<i>Our fellow citizens</i>". in the <b>KWIC view</b>, we can examine each United States N-Gram. We notice that in the left image that in "<i>The United States</i>" the "<i>of America</i>" is omitted compared to the right image. Instead, it uses prepositional language like "<i>in</i>" or "<i>to</i>". In terms of Formality, you could argue that modern day wording is slightly less formal with phrases like "<i>and we will</i>" compared to "<i>my fellow citizens</i>". But, I would still say that all the inaugural periods still contain very formal wording. 
            <br></br>Individually, The early United States speeches with people, like John Adams, talk about "<i>the people"</i> <b>ALOT.</b> Because there is also a higher frecuency count with the Early American History period, we can assume that their speeches tended to be more wordy.
            Next, during wartime "<i>Franklin D. Roosevelt</i>" was said <b>8</b> whole times, probably all from Truman. Finally, in current day, "<i>God bless you</i>" was said way more than previous inaugural texts. I find this interesting because the presence of christianity should have been way more popular back in the day. </p>
