           <p>
               Welcome to Elderfield is a horror farming role playing game (RPG). The game plans to fully release by late <b>2026.</b> The game features farming, cooking, mining, and making friends with the townspeople.
               This game was created by Chris Cote, his debut into game development. Below, you can see the art style is not an 8bit, but 16bit art style. This style is common in games like: Metroid, Street Fighter 2, and Mario's World. It contains mostly dark colors like browns, blacks, reds, and some blues to create an eerie or spooky feel.

        <h3>Game Review</h3>
        <p>
            After consuming some of the game I can confidently say this game is not meant to be very difficult. Upon fighting one of the bosses I spammed random attacks and won. This also be because it was an early boss. The hardest aspect of the game I would consider to be located the necessary objects. For example, you had to bring wheat to the Elderfield Farm which was bought at the store. The Store took a good 5 minutes to find on my own. 
            Overall, I somewhat enjoyed the game. I am not too into RPG style games, although I do like watching them. I personally, don't find them entertaining enough to sink time into. Theres no real way to get much better at them.
